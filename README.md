# Splitwise_Replica
Splitwise is an app for splitting expenses with your friends. It lets you and your friends add various bills and keep track of who owes who, and then it helps you to settle up with each other. We have created it's replica using Object Oriented Java Programming language.

In this application,
1. The user will be able to create a group and the added group’s name can be displayed under the Group List section. The user    can also delete the groups.
2. The user will be able to add members and the added member’s name can be found under the Member List section. The user can      also delete members. Member's name will also appear under Choose Payer and Split Between sections.
3. The user will be able to enter the amount and description of the expenses.
4. The user will be able to split the expenses by choosing the payer and members to split between.
5. The user will be able to see the individual balance of each member in order to settle up.
6. The user will be able to see all the list group activities or transactions and will be able to delete any.
